## Lock Box Market 

**A market place for NFTs and their Token Bound Accounts.**

NFTs can own assets through a smart contract, and most of the value from the NFT might come from those assets.

An interested buyer will want those assets locked during the selling process. As to avoid paying for something that can change.

We build a modified implementation of a TBA that can be lock through a signature scheme. Guaranteeing the integrity of the elements in the TBA.
